Dojah uses webhooks to let your application know when events happen, such as receiving an SMS message. When the event occurs, Dojah makes an HTTP request (usually a POST or a GET) to the URL you configured for the webhook. Dojah's request will include details of the event such as the service type and Webhook Url. Dojah's Webhook services allow you to subscribe for webhooks, Fetch all Webhooks subscription, and Delete a Webhook service."
