1.  IP Whitelisting
2.  Signature validation

## [](https://api-docs.dojah.io/docs/subscribe-to-services#ip-whitelisting)

With this method, you only allow certain IP addresses to access your webhook URL while blocking out others. Dojah will only send webhooks from these IP addresses:

1.  **18.117.209.2** , **3.137.39.253**

## [](https://api-docs.dojah.io/docs/subscribe-to-services#signature-validation)

Events sent from Dojah carry the **x-dojah-signature** header. The value of this header is a HMAC SHA256 signature of the event payload signed using your secret key. Verifying the header signature should be done before processing the event:

```javascript Javascript
var crypto = require('crypto');
var secret = process.env.SECRET_KEY;

// Using Express
app.post("/webhookurl", function(req, res) {
    //validate event
    const hash = crypto.createHmac('sha256', secret).update(JSON.stringify(req.body)).digest('hex');

    if (hash == req.headers['x-dojah-signature']) {
    // Retrieve the request's body
    const event = req.body;
    // Do something with event  
    }
    res.send(200);
});
```
