Dojah platform has two environments which are;

1.  **Sandbox**
2.  **Production**.

The **sandbox environment** is available to test some of our APIs before switching your application to the **production(live) environment**.

Note that;\*\*  
The test keys should be used in the sandbox environment while the production keys should be used in the production environment.
