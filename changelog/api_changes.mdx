In this release, we've updated a more flexible OTP verification process!
Introducing multi-channel OTP verification. We are giving you more control over how your users receive their one-time passcodes.

Here's what you can now do:

**Choose the channel**: Select between SMS or WhatsApp for OTP delivery, depending on your user preferences.

**Double the options**: Send the OTP to both channels simultaneously for users with potentially unreliable mobile networks. This ensures they receive their code no matter what.

With these options, you can cater to user preferences and improve the overall verification experience.

> SIDEBAR

Sidebar is an essential part of Dojah's User Dashboard, facilitating easy navigation of services.

In pursuit of a better user experience, we have opted to revamp the sidebar by consolidating some services into internal navigation rather than dropdown menus, reorganizing services, etc.

In the new sidebar, we still maintained the use of sub-titles of services, and drop-down of services under products. There were some re-categorization of some products in this sidebar.

**Quick Action:** In this new Sidebar, you can check your wallet balance and top-up from the quick action page.

**Dashboard:** This feature used to exist in the current sidebar. In the newly improved sidebar, it does not exist.

**Developers:** In the previous sidebar layout, developers were positioned as the third item users see on their users' dashboards, featuring a dropdown menu containing services like Configuration, API Tokens, API Logs, Webhooks, and Documentation. In the updated sidebar, developers have been moved towards the bottom of the sidebar and it is still presented as a dropdown menu that includes services such as Configuration, API Tokens, Webhooks, and Documentation.
