Dojah's Address verification helps businesses manage and improve the quality of their customer address information. Ensuring accurate addresses is vital for efficient shipping, billing, and communication purposes. This guide provides an overview of how our address verification works and how businesses can implement it to maintain accurate address data.

### How Address Verification Works

#### 1. Input User Address Information

The process begins when a user inputs their address details, which typically include:

-   First name
    
-   Last name
    
-   Phone number
    
-   Street address
    
-   LGA
    
-   State
    
-   Landmark
    
-   Date of Birth
    
-   Gender
    

Then you click on the "Submit Address" button to submit customer address information.

#### 2. Address Verification

Once the address information is provided, it undergoes a verification process:

-   **Validation**: The address is validated by cross-referencing it with databases from trusted data providers.
    
-   **Confirmation**: If the provided address matches an entry in the database, it is confirmed as valid/verified.
    

The process of address verification on Dojah can be done via API Integration and the Manager-Agent Portal:
