If the Dojah's services is to be accessed outside the user application, you will need API keys. You can easily copy these keys from the **configuration page**. However, to view them, you will need to enter your password for security reasons. This is to prevent unauthorized access to your Dojah account.

If your keys are compromised, you can also regenerate the keys directly from the dashboard
