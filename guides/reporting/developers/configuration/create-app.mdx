To access any of the services on the platform, you will need to do create an app. From the sidebar, click the **developers** tab and then click **configuration.** Once this is done, you should see the image below

A default app has been created, you can either choose to edit this or create a new app from scratch.

The "name of app" is the only required field to differentiate the apps. You will need the logo and primary color if you would be using the [EasyOnboard](https://guides.dojah.io/user-manual/identity-verification/easyonboard) and features. This is better explained in their sections
