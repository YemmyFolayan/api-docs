A Dojah created application entails Application Unique ID known as App ID which allows you to use tools such as Easy connect, Easy lookup, integrate with our APIâ€™s Endpoints and KYC widgets using an App Id and public key

An App ID will always be required to make API calls. So let's get you one with the following steps:


> 1.  Go to your "Developers" Dropdown tab, Click on "Configurations" .
>     
> 2.  From your "Configurations" page, create an app by clicking on "My Apps" or use this [link](https://app.dojah.io/app).
>     
> 3.  Your appID is the alphanumeric characters in the box titled your app name.
>     

While awaiting activation, you can start building in the sandbox environment using your appID.
