void main() async {
  runApp(const MyApp());

// await location.requestService();

}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  // This widget is the root of your application.
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
        title: 'Demo',
        theme: ThemeData(
            // This is the theme of your application.
            //
            // Try running your application with "flutter run". You'll see the
            // application has a blue toolbar. Then, without quitting the app, try
            // changing the primarySwatch below to Colors.green and then invoke
            // "hot reload" (press "r" in the console where you ran "flutter run",
            // or simply save your changes to "hot reload" in a Flutter IDE).
            // Notice that the counter didn't reset back to zero; the application
            // is not restarted.
            //primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
            ),

Other required installations (make sure to follow the instructions in the webview_screen documentation).

**Kindly request camera permissions before launching the widget**

> ## 📘 Request Camera Permission

> Kindly declare and request camera permission in the main activity, at your application level - MainActivity/main.dart before launching the SDK

### Android configuration 
```java Android
// Add the camera permission: 
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
// Add the modify audio settings permission:
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS" />
```

### iOS configuration 
```java iOS
permissions_path = '../ios'
pod 'Permission-Camera', :path => "#{permissions_path}/Camera"
```

###  Podfile 
```java Podfile
Kindly include this in Podfile set up.

dart: PermissionGroup.camera PERMISSION_CAMERA=1,

dart: PermissionGroup.microphone PERMISSION_MICROPHONE=1,

dart: PermissionGroup.location PERMISSION_LOCATION=1,
```

### infoplist

```java info.plist
Add the following keys to your Info.plist file, 
located in <project root>/ios/Runner/Info.plist:

NSCameraUsageDescription - 
  describe why your app needs access to the camera. This is called Privacy - Camera Usage Description in the visual editor.

NSMicrophoneUsageDescription -
  describe why your app needs access to the microphone, if you intend to record videos. This is called Privacy - Microphone Usage Description in the visual editor.

NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription - 
    describe why your app needs access to the location, if you intend to verify address/location. This is called Privacy - Location Usage Description in the visual editor.
```



Run your flutter Project

**Step 3: Handle a Successful Enrollment**

On successful enrollment, the _onSuccess _callback function that you supplied is called by the SDK. We then return the connected account code to your server.

## 

Alternative configuration instead of Specifying pages Array from the SDK

[](https://api-docs.dojah.io/docs/flutter-sdk#alternative-configuration-instead-of-specifying-pages-array-from-the-sdk)

The main advantage of this feature is to enable you make changes to your widget flow or configuration on Dojah Dashboard [here](https://app.dojah.io/easy-onboard)here instead of rebuilding or modifying the main Flutter Application.  
Implementation Example

```
<span data-testid="SyntaxHighlighter">            
final configObj = {


"widget_id": "your widget ID",
  
  
}
</span>
```

Kindly use the overall status (**response.status** (Boolean, i.e _true or false_)) to ascertain if the request failed or succeeded.

> ## 📘 Webhook Notifications
> 
> You can receive the same data below (also passed to onSuccess and onError) via a webhook call.
> 
> Register your url for webhook calls [here](https://api-docs.dojah.io/docs/subscribe-to-services) and ensure `kyc.widget` is the `service` you are subscribed to.
> 
> In Config object Kindly set **webhook** object value to true (Boolean)
> 
> Example : **webhook : true**

>           publicKey: "p_key",  
>           type: "custom",  
>           userData: userData,

> ## 📘 How to Fix Android File Upload Crash
> 
> ```text 
>  STEP 1:
> 
> 
> Open the AndroidManifest.xml file located in the android/app/src/main directory of your Flutter project.
> 
> Inside the &lt;application&gt; tag, add the following code:
> &lt;provider android:name="androidx.core.content.FileProvider" android:authorities="com.example.dojah_kyc.flutter_inappwebview.fileprovider" android:exported="false" android:grantUriPermissions="true"&gt; &lt;meta-data android:name="android.support.FILE_PROVIDER_PATHS" android:resource="@xml/provider_paths" /&gt; &lt;/provider&gt; 
> Make sure to replace com.example.dojah_kyc with your application’s package name.
> 
> 
> STEP 2: 
> 
> Create a new file named provider_paths.xml in the android/app/src/main/res/xml directory (create the xml directory if it doesn’t exist). Add the following code to the provider_paths.xml file:
> 
> &lt;paths xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"&gt; &lt;external-path name="external_files" path="." /&gt; &lt;/paths&gt; 
> 
> 
> 
> STEP 3: 
> 
> Save the changes and rebuild your Flutter application.
> By following these steps, you should be able to properly configure the file provider and resolve the “Couldn’t find meta-data for provider” error when selecting files with the file picker in your Flutter application on Android devices.
